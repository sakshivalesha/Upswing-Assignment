Set up the MongoDB connection: Configure your application to connect to the MongoDB database where the weather data is stored. Use the appropriate MongoDB driver or an Object Document Mapper (ODM) library like Mongoose (for Node.js) to interact with the database.

Define the API endpoint: Create a route or URL endpoint in your application that will handle the weather data retrieval. For example, you could use the following endpoint: GET /weather-data.

Handle the API request: In the server-side code, receive the incoming request to the /weather-data endpoint. Extract any query parameters sent by the client to filter the weather data. The query parameters could include location, date range, temperature range, etc.

Query the MongoDB database: Use the query parameters to construct a MongoDB query that retrieves the desired weather data from the database. You can use the appropriate query operators (e.g., $gt, $lt, $in) to filter the data 
based on the parameters provided. For example, to filter by location and date range, your query might look like:



db.weather.find({
  location: "New York",
  date: {
    $gte: ISODate("2023-01-01T00:00:00Z"),
    $lte: ISODate("2023-01-31T23:59:59Z")
  }
})


Retrieve the weather data: Execute the constructed MongoDB query and retrieve the matching weather data from the database.

Perform data transformation or aggregation: Once you have the weather data, you can perform any required data transformation or aggregation operations to calculate statistical information. For example, you can calculate the average, maximum, and minimum temperature for the given date range or location.

Format the API response: Design a response format that provides the necessary weather information to the client. Typically, this would be in a structured format such as JSON. Include the retrieved weather data and the calculated statistical information in the response payload.

Return the API response: Send the formatted response back to the client as the API response. Ensure that the response includes the appropriate HTTP status code and headers.

By following these steps, you can implement an API endpoint that retrieves weather data from a MongoDB database, allows filtering by various parameters, and returns the desired weather information along with statistical calculations.
